<h2>Castle Crusade</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Castle Crusade is an original multiplayer game that puts one player against the other in a medieval battle to destroy their opponents castle. In this game the players will take turns firing cannon balls or other attacks at their opponent’s castle in order to destroy the blocks that make up their castle. Each castle consists of a set of stacked blocks that can fall and that each have a health/stamina amount. As far as I know, there is not a game just like this.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game uses many new technical aspects of phaser which I have not used before including Tweens, passing information between scenes, and using more advanced features of arcade physics including gravity.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The most challenging part about this prototype was keeping all of the assets and game objects in order because there were so many to keep straight for each user and for each castle, etc. Furthermore, it was extremely challenging TO keep the flow of execution correct because of the multiplayer nature of the game, which caused the flow of the programing to be very non-linear.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Some Assets were made from scratch, some were modified from other assets, and some were obtained from online sources:

</ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The games that are closest to this game prototype concept are the mobile games Castle Wreck and very lightly Angry Birds. Castle Wreck is a game where you destroy 3D castles with cannons, but the castles are just autogenerated levels which you must destroy within a certain number of hits. My game will pit one player against another until one players castle is destroyed and will feature multiple intricacies such as powerups and different cannons/attack methods. My game will also feature 2D castles where each castle bock has a health amount. I also said it is similar to Angry Birds because I envision the user input being similar to that game but with the front perspective/view of facing the castle instead of a side view that you would have with Angry Birds. The phaser examples and tutorials that I based my game off of are listed below:

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Castle Crusade is a competitive two-player game where players are pitted against one another in a medieval battle to destroy their enemies castle before they destroy yours.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Medieval Castles
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For the mandated variety aspects I chose:
<ul>
<li>Inputs: Clickable Buttons on menu interfaces and Spacebar </li>
<li>Randomness: Fair bit of randomness (exact moment of hitting spacebar and which player goes first)</li>
<li>Playstles: Achiever and </li>
<li>Genres: Multiplayer</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
In this early prototype iteration, I would like to test the core game mechanics of this game such as the turn sequence, the actions of aiming and firing the at the castle, and how castle blocks are destroyed. This will allow me to test whether the fundamental player experience is fun enough to play. In subsequent prototypes, I would test supplemental features that make gameplayer much more interesting including powerups, different turn options such as repairing your own castle blocks, and even different attacks/weapons.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
While playing this game, players should have a strong sense of competitiveness against their opponent and should feel as if they are immersed within a spirited medieval battle. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The basic gameplay consists of two players taking turns of the following sequence:\n
<ul>
<li>The choice between attacking your opponent’s castle or rebuilding your own castle (restoring the health level of some of your own castles block). </li>
<li>If you choose to attack your opponent, your opponent’s castle will appear on the screen and your cannon will appear in the lower middle section of the screen. You will use the mouse to drag the aim of the cannon to hit your opponents castle. The aim indicator will wiggle slightly as to introduce randomness into the game and ensure that you aim at the right exact moment. Once you let go of the cannon aimer, your aim will be locked in. After, a power indicator will fluctuate between maximum power and minimal power (adjusting the attack power amount). You must hit the spacebar at the exact right moment so that the power is maximum (difficult as it is fluctuating very quickly). After this the cannon will fire and inflict damage on your opponent’s castle.</li>
<li>If the amount of damage is above the level of health of the block which the cannon ball hits, then it is automatically destroyed, and other blocks can fall downward due to gravity. If they fall off the platform which the castle is sitting on, then they are automatically destroyed. After each turn, the players remaining blocks will appear on the screen with each of their health levels shown.</li>
<li>If you chose to restore the health of your castle, your castle will appear on the screen with each of the health levels shown. You select one of your blocks and it will restore that block to full strength.</li>
</ul>
This sequence of turns repeats until one of the players’ castle is completely destroyed. The player that goes first is chosen randomly by the game at the beginning of the game. Below is a summary of the controls for this game:

<ul>
<li>Mouse: Navigate Menu's/Buttons</li>
<li>Spacebar: Lock in Vertical Aim, Horizontal Aim, & Power</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Aim toward bottom blocks and blocks that would cause their opponents other castle blocks to fall of the castle platform. This will allow you to cause additional damage as compared to just hitting one block.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The premise of this game is that each player is the lead commander of a medieval army. Unfortunately, the war has reached a stalemate and now a battle is brewing in a valley where each side has a stronghold castle. The fate of the battle depends on which side can destroy their opponents castle first. This dramatic tension creates a strong sense of competitiveness between each of the two players causing the gameplay tension to be elevated.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is targeted towards individuals that enjoy competitive multiplayer games, individuals who enjoy medieval themed games, and people who like games that combine the perfect amount of randomness, fast-paced gaming, and strategy.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depending on skill of players, typically 5 minutes to play, but can be up to 10 minutes.
