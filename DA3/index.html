<h2>Laundromat Escape!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Laundromat Escape is an original game that mixes the two thematic cards of laundromat and a person with many cats. As far as I know, there is no other game like it where you must escape a laundry map in order to avoid cats. It is such a unique premise.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game uses many new technical aspects of phaser that I have not used before including spriteset animations, collision handlers, and dedicated game scenes for loading, winning/losing, and game play screens.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned lots by making this prototype, by far the most significant thing that I learned from this prototype was how to use scenes to create a more cohesive game experience that guides the user throughout the game and make the game more cohesive.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Some Assets were made from scratch, some were modified from other assets, and some were obtained from online sources:

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
For this assignment I did not really follow any example games, rather I used the following guides as reference for the features I wanted to add
<ul>
<li> Phaser3 Documentation:<a href="https://rexrainbow.github.io/phaser3-rex-notes/docs/site/">Phaser3 Documentation</li>
<li> Spritesets:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0K0YTifb1w">Spriteset Tutorial</a> </li>
<li> Loading Scene:<a href="https://gamedevacademy.org/creating-a-preloading-screen-in-phaser-3/?a=13">Loading Scene Tutorial</a></li>
<li> Audio: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COncYQLGJS8">Audio Tutorial</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
In this challenging game someone with several cats has brought them all to the laundromat, and now you must escape the laundromat while avoiding the cats so that you clean nice laundry does not get messed up.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
For this assignment I chose the storymatic cards "Person with a lot of cats" and "Laundromat". It was interesting pairing such different themes.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than one minute if you are good/lucky, up to five minutes otherwise.
</li>
