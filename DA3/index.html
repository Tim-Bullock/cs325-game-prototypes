<h2>Laundromat Escape!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Laundromat Escape is an original game that mixes the two thematic cards of laundromat and a person with many cats. As far as I know, there is no other game like it where you must escape a laundry map in order to avoid cats. It is such a unique premise.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game uses many new technical aspects of phaser that I have not used before including spriteset animations, collision handlers, and dedicated game scenes for loading, winning/losing, and game play screens.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned lots by making this prototype, by far the most significant thing that I learned from this prototype was how to use scenes to create a more cohesive game experience that guides the user throughout the game and make the game more cohesive.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Some Assets were made from scratch, some were modified from other assets, and some were obtained from online sources:

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
For this assignment I did not really follow any example games, rather I used the following guides as reference for the features I wanted to add
<ul>
<li> Phaser3 Documentation:<a href="https://rexrainbow.github.io/phaser3-rex-notes/docs/site/">Phaser3 Documentation</li>
<li> Spritesets:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0K0YTifb1w">Spriteset Tutorial</a> </li>
<li> Loading Scene:<a href="https://gamedevacademy.org/creating-a-preloading-screen-in-phaser-3/?a=13">Loading Scene Tutorial</a></li>
<li> Audio: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COncYQLGJS8">Audio Tutorial</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
In this challenging game someone with several cats has brought them all to the laundromat, and now you must escape the laundromat while avoiding the cats so that you clean nice laundry does not get messed up.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
For this assignment I chose the storymatic cards "Person with a lot of cats" and "Laundromat". It was interesting pairing such different themes.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For the mandated variety aspects I chose:
<ul>
<li>Inputs: Clickable Buttons and Keyboard</li>
<li>Randomness: A fair amount of randomness (speed of cat sprites)</li>
<li>Playstles: Achiever and Performer</li>
<li>Genres: Overhead</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
In this prototype, I wanted to test the core game mechanics such as the ability for the user to move when the cat's speeds were randomized, as well as have a deeper dive into the stylistic aspects game creation in phaser to see how they effect the user experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
While playing this game users should feel challenged by the randomness of the cat's movements and puzzled by the strange premise of the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In this prototype the user has five simple actions/controls that are needed to find play the game:
<ul>
<li>Mouse: Navigate Menu's/Buttons</li>
<li>Left Arrow Key: Run Left</li>
<li>Right Arrow Key: Run Right</li>
<li>Up Arrow Key: Run Up</li>
<li>Down Arrow Key: Run Down</li>
</ul>
To play this game the user must use the arrow keys in order to reach the exit of the Laundromat (located at the bottom of the screen). However there are several cats that get in the way; if you run into one, you lose and must start over. The cats mover back and forth at random velocities which makes it challenging to predict when it will be optimal to move. In future prototypes of this game, I would like to add more levels (maybe even randomly generated ones, add the ability for the cats to "jump" over the washing machines to make the game more challenging, and give the cats and animated running spriteset.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The spaces in between the rows washers/dryers are useful as you can pause here and wait for the opportune moment to get past the cats.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The premise of this game is that one day a crazy stranger turns up to the laundromat will all of her cats. This is not just one or two! There are many! You, the player, were just finishing your laundry and now must find a way to escape the laundromat without running into any cats as they will claw and tear your clothes to shreds. This tension gives rise to the game tension as it is the players sole goal to try to exit the laudromat.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like cats, top-down games where you must avoid obstacles (such as classic Frogger Arcade game), or intriguing games with strange premises.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than one minute if you are good/lucky, up to five minutes otherwise.
</li>
