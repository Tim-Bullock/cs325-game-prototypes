<h2>Space Savior</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This is a simple yet interesting adventure-like/ puzzle game that requires the user to find an astronaut that is lost in space. To my knowledge, there is no other game that is like it, but it is similar to maze games where the user has to find an object or location.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This simple game uses many features of phaser. For example the asteroids are placed in the map using a tile map, and the rocket's movements are set in such a way that they represent the way a rocket would be able to travel in space using angular velocities and drag. The background moves by using a tilesprite which changes based on the rockets location.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is based strongly on the "Simple Map" Phaser 3 example (<a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/game-objects/tilemap/collision/simple-map>Found here</a>). 
The rockets movement is also based on the the phaser 2 example (<a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/tilemaps/features-test">Found here</a>)
The moving background is based on code from the Phaser 3 docs(<a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/tile-sprites/tiling-sprite">Found here</a>)
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
In this puzzling maze-type game, the user must find an astronaut hopelessly lost in space by navigating .
