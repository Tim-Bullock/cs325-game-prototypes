<h2>Space Savior</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This is a simple yet interesting adventure-like/ puzzle game that requires the user to find an astronaut that is lost in space. To my knowledge, there is no other game that is like it, but it is similar to maze games where the user has to find an object or location.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This simple game uses many features of phaser. For example the asteroids are placed in the map using a tile map, and the rocket's movements are set in such a way that they represent the way a rocket would be able to travel in space using angular velocities and drag. The background moves by using a tilesprite which changes based on the rockets location.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
From this prototype, I learned many things about how games are created using phaser. For one I learned how to create sprites, tilesprites, and even tilemaps in phaser. Secondly, I learned lots about how physics and collisions happen in phaser. The hardest part of this assignment for me to implement was definitely the tilemap as I had to create a JSON file using an external program called "Tiled" so that the asteroids would appear throughout the map.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is based strongly on the "Simple Map" Phaser 3 example (<a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/game-objects/tilemap/collision/simple-map">Found here</a>). 
The rockets movement is also based on the the phaser 2 example (<a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/tilemaps/features-test">Found here</a>).
The moving background is based on code from the Phaser 3 docs(<a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/tile-sprites/tiling-sprite">Found here</a>).
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
In this puzzling maze-type game, the user must find an astronaut hopelessly lost in space by navigating though numerous asteroids in an seemingly endless and confusing array of outer space. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Adventure, Rescue, Science Fiction, Space travel
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
In this prototype the input was set to be the arrow keys. Randomness was introduced by placing the astronaut at a random position that is off the initial screen each time the user restarts the game. The genre for this game is science fiction, and play style is adventure/maze.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
In this prototype, I was hoping to test the core game mechanics such as the way the player moves the rocket throughout the environment, and the way that the rocket interacts with the asteroids in the map. I also wanted to test the game play to see if finding an astronaut in a maze of asteroids was interesting enough to play without any special non-essential features such as alien sprites or countdown timers.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
When playing this game, users should feel like the space map is nearly endless and feel challenged to find the astronaut that is lost in space. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In this prototype the user has three simple actions/controls that are needed to find the astronaut:
<li>Left Arrow Key: Rotate Rocket Counter-clockwise</li>
<li>Right Arrow Key: Rotate Rocket Clockwise</li>
<li>Up Arrow Key: Propel Rocket Forward</li>
These controls allow the user to conduct the core game mechanics of moving the rocket and interacting with asteroids. The user must use these control's to navigate though the maze of asteroids and find the astronaut that is loaded at a random position in the map. In future prototypes of this game, I would like to add a countdown timer so that there is a timed limit to the game and alien sprites that attack the rocket and cause the rocket's position to be rest (however these are extra features that don't test the games core mechanics).
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Try to keep track of where you have already been my recognizing patterns in the asteroids. You can also reference yourself using the solid lines of asteroids that surround the game's border.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In this slightly abstract game world, there is an astronaut that got left being and is lost somewhere randomly in space. Fortunately, the player in the red rocket has gone on a mission to find the astronaut and rescue him from the endless abyss of outer space. The player must search though a vast map that is filled with asteroids that disorient and impede the player in their quest. This dramatic tension will cause the user to search throughout the space world in order to find the astronaut.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is targeted towards people who love space travel and individuals who love to be challenged by maze-style games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than five minutes
