<h2>Castle Crusade III</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Castle Crusade is an original multiplayer game that puts one player against the other in a medieval battle to destroy their opponents castle. In this game the players will take turns firing cannon balls or other attacks at their opponent’s castle in order to destroy the blocks that make up their castle. Each castle consists of a set of stacked blocks that can fall and that each have a health/stamina amount. As far as I know, there is not a game just like this.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
While this game mostly uses the same Phaser3 features that the first two prototype used (like tweens, passing information between scenes, advanced arcade physics collisions), the uses of many of these elements were greatly extended to support a much more complex turn and play sequence. With the addition of different weapons and powerups that each player can choose, it makes the flow of the game much less linear and as a result many different phaser elements were introduced in order to tract this. As a result, in this revision this game grew from 1200 to over 2700 lines of code in just the game scene alone.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The most challenging part about this prototype was managing the flow of execution and managing the many many game elements since the multiplayer nature of the game and all the different power and weapon options caused the flow of the programing to be very non-linear.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Some Assets were made from scratch, some were modified from other assets, and some were obtained from online sources:

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The games that are closest to this game prototype concept are the mobile games Castle Wreck and very lightly Angry Birds. Castle Wreck is a game where you destroy 3D castles with cannons, but the castles are just autogenerated levels which you must destroy within a certain number of hits. My game will pit one player against another until one players castle is destroyed and will feature multiple intricacies such as powerups and different cannons/attack methods. My game will also feature 2D castles where each castle bock has a health amount. I also said it is similar to Angry Birds because I envision the user input being similar to that game but with the front perspective/view of facing the castle instead of a side view that you would have with Angry Birds. Additionally, the blocks will have health like the Pigs in Angry Birds. The phaser examples and tutorials that I based my game off of are listed below:

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Castle Crusade is a competitive two-player game where players are pitted against one another in a medieval battle to destroy their enemies castle before they destroy yours.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Medieval Castles
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For the mandated variety aspects I chose (same as original prototype):
<ul>
<li>Inputs: Clickable Buttons on menu interfaces and Enter Key </li>
<li>Randomness: Fair bit of randomness (exact moment of hitting Enter Key and which player goes first)</li>
<li>Playstles: Achiever and Competitor</li>
<li>Genres: Multiplayer</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
In this second prototype I several additional features that have a great impact of the core mechanics of the game. These included:
<ul>
<li>Adding Regular Cannon Attacking Weapon,</li>
<li>Adding Fire Cannon Attacking Weapon,</li>
<li>Adding Trebuchet Attacking Weapon,</li>
<li>Adding Accuracy Potion Attacking Power-Up,</li>
<li>Adding Sneak Attack Attacking Power-Up,</li>
<li>Adding Bronze Shield Defending Power-Up,</li>
<li>Adding Silver Shield Defending Power-Up,</li>
<li>Adding Gold Shield Defending Power-Up,</li>
<li>Adding Visual Polish</li>
</ul>
Adding these features allowed me to make the game less linear and predictable. It also allowed me to alter game's core mechanics to be more strategic, as the user now has to decide what weapon and power-ups to use. This prototype allowed me to test these improved core mechanics and nonlinear nature of the game play to ensure that the game is more fun and interesting. In subsequent prototypes, I would test additional game modes such as Single Player Game Mode.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
While playing this game, players should have a strong sense of competitiveness against their opponent and should feel as if they are immersed within a spirited medieval battle. They should also feel the need to strategize as power-ups and special weapons are limited resources which can only be used a number of times.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The basic gameplay consists of two players taking turns of the following sequence:\n
<ul>
<li>The choice between attacking your opponent’s castle or rebuilding your own castle (restoring the health level of some of your own castles block). </li>
<li>If you choose to attack your opponent, your opponent’s castle will appear on the screen and your cannon will appear in the lower middle section of the screen. You can choose a power-up or different weapon (if they are availavble) using the Attack Menu. After, an aim indicator will fluctuate left and right. You must hit the enter key at the exact right moment so that the horizontal aim is set properly. After, the aimer will move up and down, and you hit enter again to set in the vertical aim is set properly. Finally, a power indicator will appear and you must hit enter key one more to set the power level between 0 and the maximum of your chosen weapon. After this the weapon will fire and inflict damage on your opponent’s castle.</li>
<li>As soon as you hit space for the first time in Attack Mode, your weapon is locked in. However, if you have a power-up left, you can use it at any time in the turn. A summary of Attacking Weapons and power ups is below:<li>
<ul>
<li>Regular Cannon - Maximum Damage of 100 and Regular Aiming Speed. Can be used every turn. Default if no other weapon is choosen.</li>
<li>Fire Cannon - Maximum Damage of 200 but Very Fast Aiming Speed. Can be used every three turns.</li>
<li>Fire Cannon - Maximum Damage of 50 and Regular Aiming Speed but you get two shots per turn. Can be used every three turns.</li>
<li>Accuracy Potion  - Slows the aimer down significantly. Two Uses per Game </li>
<li>Sneak Attack - Automatically Destroy your Enemy's Lowest Health Block. One Use per Game </li>
</ul>
<li>Once a weapon is fired and the weapon hits a castle block, if the amount of damage is above the level of health of the block which the weapon hits, then it is destroyed, and other blocks can fall downward due to gravity. If they fall off the platform which the castle is sitting on, then they are automatically destroyed. After each turn, the players remaining blocks will appear on the screen with each of their health levels shown.</li>
<li>If you chose to defend and restore the health of your castle, your castle will appear on the screen with each of the health levels shown. You select one of your blocks and it will restore that block to full strength. Once you restore the one block, your defensive turn is over. However instead of just restoring one block, you can use a power-up (if you have any remaining). These are shown below:</li>
<ul>
<li>Bronze Castle Shield - Add 30 health to three blocks of your castle. Two Uses per Game </li>
<li>Silver Castle Shield - Add 50 health to two blocks of your castle. Two Uses per Game </li>
<li>Gold Castle Shield - Restore two castle blocks to full health (100). One Use per Game </li>
</ul>
</ul>
This sequence of turns repeats until one of the players’ castle is completely destroyed. The player that goes first is chosen randomly by the game at the beginning of the game. Below is a summary of the controls for this game:

<ul>
<li>Mouse: Navigate Menu's/Buttons, Click Castle Blocks to Restore Them In Defending Mode</li>
<li>Enter Key: Lock in Vertical Aim, Horizontal Aim, & Power</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Aim toward bottom blocks and blocks that would cause their opponents other castle blocks to fall of the castle platform. This will allow you to cause additional damage as compared to just hitting one block. Save your power-ups for later in the game, it will be beneficial if you can automatically take out your opponents last block or restore your own last block.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The premise of this game is that each player is the lead commander of a medieval army. Unfortunately, the war has reached a stalemate and now a battle is brewing in a valley where each side has a stronghold castle. The fate of the battle depends on which side can destroy their opponents castle first. This dramatic tension creates a strong sense of competitiveness between each of the two players causing the gameplay tension to be elevated.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is targeted towards individuals that enjoy competitive multiplayer games, individuals who enjoy medieval themed games, and people who like games that combine the perfect amount of randomness, fast-paced gaming, and strategy.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depending on skill of players, typically 5 minutes to play, but can be up to 10 minutes.
